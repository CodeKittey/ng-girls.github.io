Additionally, I recently organized a ngGirls event in Kansas City under the KCWiT umbrella.

    title: "&nbsp;"
    company: "This Dot Labs"
    bio: "<p>Rob has had a lifelong love affair with coding. He still gets exceptionally geeked out and makes all his coworkers look when he solves a difficult problem or codes up a novel solution. Because of this, Rob also has a passion for mentoring new and aspiring developers and finding bite-sized ways to explain difficult concepts in modern JavaScript development. The look on the face of an inspired developer who understands something they didn't before is his anti-drug. Rob has been a professional software developer for over 10 years working on everything from DoD defense systems to mathematical modeling software, a web developer for the last 4 years building apps for everyone from insurance companies to numismatists, and is fascinated with front-end frameworks and their power to bring ever more diverse developers into the profession. When not developing, Rob spends time keeping up with his two year old son, is an avid fan of JRPGs, and is obsessed with college basketball.</p>"

I think ngGirls is a great program, and so far haven't been able to help out at all. Doing this online makes it a bit easier for me!</p>"

I want to be a mentor because I think everyone should experience the creativity of webdev, and I think Angular is perfect for getting started. Being a mentor at the Angular workshop in Denmark (just before ngVikings) was so much fun, and I want to join again :)</p>"
