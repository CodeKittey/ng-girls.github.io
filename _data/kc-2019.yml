   Building up other engineers lets you grow your network (good for when you need a new job), and grow your skill set.
   Teaching others how to do something strengthens your understanding of a subject, and your new friends can teach you in return as they grow.
   Building up other women helps the development world by not feeling alone in a sea of men at every conference and every job.</p>'
