  description: "In July 2014 I've been chosen to participate in Django Girls Berlin, as part of Europe's PyConf. I had just finished my M.Sc. and was thinking about the future. Although I've had programming experience, this event inspired me to explore the world of development, and especially Web development, even deeper, and join the Tech industry. Today I am ready to give back. So not with Django, but with Angular, which I really love."
  bio: "Shmuela Jacobs is a front-end developer and consultant mastering Angular. During her academic studies (M.Sc. in Information Management Engineering and B.Sc. in Physics) she has combined her passions of coding and teaching as a software developer, teaching assistant, science museum guide, and researcher. Today she continues to enjoy these activities as a full-time developer, sharing her knowledge and experience in meetups and conferences around the world."

  message: "<p>The last years I’ve learned how great diversity can be. I was in some conferences with big diversity support
          (like jsunconf and craft conf). I met a lot of clever female developer and speaker from which know-how I was
          impressed and learned. And I think there are a lot more outside and a lot more who have the talent.
          So it is important to support them.</p>
          <p>As Shmuela asked for that, I decided within in 30s that it would be an honor to do that.</p>
          <p>There are several projects with an impressive diversity support and very good material.<p>
          <p>And last but not least I’m still reading the book of Software craftsmanship by Sandro Mancuso
          in which he shows how important and good it can be to give something back to the community and how important
          it is to learn from other developers. And I think I could also learn as a mentor from the participants.</p>

Since a couple of years I'm doing mostly frontend in corporations. I was working among others at gazeta.pl and gazetapraca.pl in Agora. Currently I work in CyberVadis. I was also a mentor in program Maker Teens: Girl Power organised by Girls Code Fun Fundation this year. I like to help other to learn new technologies and share the knowledge so that's why I decided to participate in ngGirls as a mentor.

My motto is: 'Do it with passion or not at all' and that's how I treat it. I chose the frontend path because I'm also an artist. I like to combine this two aspects of life. I like creating something beautiful but also useful. 
I want to break the stereotypes of being a programmer. Programming is for anyone who loves to create, who loves to get out of their comfort zone, and for anyone who loves to improve themselves."
