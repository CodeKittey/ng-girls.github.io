    bio: '<p>Nicole is a web developer working at Nintendo. After earning a degree in Studio Art,
    she stepped away from the canvas to try her hand at web design and user experience,
    and eventually hit it off with web development.
    She has since traversed a number of front and back-end web technologies,
    becoming particularly familiar with vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, Sass, and of course, Angular.
    She is a co-organizer of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/angular-seattle/" target="_blank">Angular Seattle</a>,
    and still proudly rocks a paint brush when time allows.</p>'
