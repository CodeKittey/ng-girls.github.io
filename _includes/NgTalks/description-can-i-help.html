  <p>Of course! There are several ways you can help: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Mentors</b> - you have a great impact on the participants' experience.
      If you can volunteer at the workshop and give some support on the days before and after, we'd love to have you!
      You don't need to be an Angular expert - just a web developer.

    </li>
    <li>
       <b>Speakers, trainers, consultants</b> - we're holding a second ngGirls day for the first time, in which the participants
       will be exposed to general Web and development concepts as well as Hi-Tech soft skills. <b>We're looking for your content</b> -
       would you like to talk about web technologies and protocols? How to debug and test an app? How to find the perfect
       job? Please <a href-="{{ site.data.NgTalks.mentorsForm }}" target="_blank">apply as a mentor</a>
       and suggest your talk or mini-workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Sponsors</b> - with your help we can make our events truly awesome! From funding tickets to Angular conferences,
      through supplying lunch, to providing swag - lots of opportunities to help.
