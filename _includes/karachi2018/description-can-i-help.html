  <p>Of course! There are several ways you can help: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Mentors</b> - you have a great impact on the participants' experience. If you can volunteer at the workshop and give
      some support on the days before and after, we'd love to have you! You don't need to be an Angular expert - just a web
      developer.

    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Speakers, trainers, consultants</b> - we're holding a series of ngGirls workshops for the first time, in which the
      participants will be exposed to general Front-end web and development concepts as well as Hi-Tech soft skills. We're
      looking for your content - would you like to talk about frontend web technologies? How to debug and test an app? How
      to find the perfect job? Please apply as a mentor and suggest your talk or mini-workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Sponsors</b> - with your help we can make our events truly awesome! From funding tickets to Angular conferences, through
      supplying lunch, to providing swag - lots of opportunities to help.

      <b>Anyone</b> - There are many other ways to help us. We'd love to hear your ideas and/or assign you some chores. Huge
      thanks in advance!
